### Garden Design 
 ![3D garden design model](assets/img/Services3Dshow.jpg)

We will create your dream garden. We provide a full garden design service, from initial design, to detailed drawings so your garden will be built as designed. We can also help with planning applications, and monitoring the build. Once the garden is finished we support you with follow up visits and providing advice to help keep the garden looking good as it matures. 

Our [garden design process](/process) page shows you how we work to transform your outdoor space into the garden you desire.  Give us a call if you would like to have a chat about your garden requirements.

### Planting Design 

Personally selected and informed plant choices to create the garden of your choice for the growing conditions.
We can design planting for a new garden, border, or  rejuvinate existing borders with new complimentary planting.
We also arrange the sourcing of the plants and plant into prepared borders.
