## Sunny Coastal Garden ##
This sunny enclosed garden is located in a conservation area of a historic fishing village in East Lothian. The owner wanted to increase the size of the seating area, while keeping it in the same location. The challenge was the house was accessed by  doors on different levels. 

The client also wanted to  increase their privacy as the garden was overlooked  from a neighbouring property. 

Broken paving was to be replaced and the owner wanted lots of plants and loved colour. 

Planning permission was secured prior to the build starting.

The solution to the seating area was a new millboard composite deck on one level making the seating area accessible from different doors of the house. A larch wall topper was added for extra privacy to the old garden walls. 

The broken concrete paving was lifted, crushed  and reused on site as hardcore below new sandstone paths. 

The lawn was replaced with a large planting bed full of colourful perennials and small shrubs with a feature water bowl. 

Many of the original plants were retained and replanted.  

A small gravel  planting area was introduced so it could double up as an area for drying washing, making this small garden not only beautiful but also practical. 

Garden images are of planting in first year with planting still to mature.
