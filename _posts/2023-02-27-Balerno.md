Planting Design â€“ Edinburgh 

This large modern garden was newly designed and landscaped when Blackwood Gardens  was brought in to do the planting design. The owners wanted low maintenance planting with texture and topiary to compliment and soften the hard landscaping materials. 

The planting was designed with structural hornbeam pillars,  topiary evergreen shrubs and  specimen trees underplanted with textural grasses. The back border consisted of only white flowers and a  limited warm colour palette was used in the rest of the garden. Key plants were repeated to give the garden rhythm and  unity.

The planting is still maturing and images shown are in their first year. Mature trees and shrubs were used to help establish the garden.
