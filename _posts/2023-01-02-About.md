Blackwood Gardens is a design studio based in North Berwick serving East Lothian and the Edinbugh area. We work in partnership with landscape professionals to deliver quality garden transformations of all shapes and sizes across Scotland. 

Anna Blackwood runs Blackwood Gardens, she trained in Garden Design at SRUC in Edinburgh and studied horticulture at RGBE. She is a pre-registered member of the Society of Garden designers.

Anna comes from a long line of gardeners, she is enthusiastic and knowledgeable about plants. She has spent time working in a specialist plant nursery, growing her knowledge. She has her own large garden, where she enjoys trialling plants.  This makes plant selection second nature to her when it comes to designing gardens for you
 
Her previous career was as a marketeer and customer experience lead, enabling her to utilise project management skills in every garden, where clients are at the heart of every decision; from the initial design, to monitoring the build and seeing the garden grow into its new life.

Anna is a natural problem solver and loves the challenge of transforming outdoor spaces into beautiful, practical gardens loved by their owner.
