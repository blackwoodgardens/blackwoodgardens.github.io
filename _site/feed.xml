<p>The brief was to improve access around the garden as it had awkward steps, a steep planting bank, slippery deck and rough gravel paths. The owner is a keen gardener and wanted lots of space for planting, a wildlife pond and space to grow vegetables. They also wanted a new seating area with a combined shed/greenhouse building and summerhouse.</p>

<p>The design uses lots of organic shapes and curves, featuring a smooth resin bound path which provides easy access around the garden.  A beautiful curved paddlestone wall separates upper and lower planting terraces. The central pond can be viewed from the house as well as from the summerhouse. The design includes a new porcelain patio and raised beds for growing veg. All the utilities are screened in the side passage.

<p>The concrete path was changed to riven sandstone and edged with cropped setts. The bins were relocated into a new bin store away from the front of the house and a purpose made bench was added at the front door.</p>

<p>Many of the shrubs were retained and relocated during the build. The muddy lawns were replaced with gravel planting, giving the garden more colour, texture and biodiversity.</p>

<p>The materials were selected to compliment the house and area with  planting selected for its coastal location.</p>

<p>This large modern garden was newly designed and landscaped when Blackwood Gardens  was brought in to do the planting design. The owners wanted low maintenance planting with texture and topiary to compliment and soften the hard landscaping materials.</p>

<p>The planting was designed with structural hornbeam pillars,  topiary evergreen shrubs and  specimen trees underplanted with textural grasses. The back border consisted of only white flowers and a  limited warm colour palette was used in the rest of the garden. Key plants were repeated to give the garden rhythm and  unity.</p>

<p>The planting is still maturing and images shown are in their first year. Mature trees and shrubs were used to help establish the garden.</p>

<p>This sunny enclosed garden is located in a conservation area of a historic fishing village in East Lothian. The owner wanted to increase the size of the seating area, while keeping it in the same location. The challenge was the house was accessed by  doors on different levels.</p>

<p>The client also wanted to  increase their privacy as the garden was overlooked  from a neighbouring property.</p>

<p>Broken paving was to be replaced and the owner wanted lots of plants and loved colour.</p>

<p>Planning permission was secured prior to the build starting.</p>

<p>The solution to the seating area was a new millboard composite deck on one level making the seating area accessible from different doors of the house. A larch wall topper was added for extra privacy to the old garden walls.

Even a garden with no plants needs work; gravel weeded, patios cleaned, wooden structures protected, leaves swept up and the list goes on.</p>

<h3 id="fewer-plants-often-means-less-weeding">Fewer plants often means less weeding</h3>

<p>My own garden is stuffed with plants which means very little weeding, as there is less space for the weeds to self-seed. 
With a little knowledge of how to look after the plants in your garden, you can have a relatively easy garden to look after without too much to do.</p>

<p>When I was training to be a garden designer I did some garden maintenance work.</p>

<p>I worked on a garden that was designed as a winter garden for owners who only lived there in the winter.</p>

<p>They contacted me as they had been let down by a maintenance company and the neighbours were complaining about their neglected garden. 
The weeds were rampant.</p>

<p>I did a big clearance job and got it under control and then visited the garden every 7/14 days, but it was a fighting battle, every time I went the weeds were back.</p>

<p>The problem was the garden had so much exposed soil it was a weed factory.</p>

<p>Yes, they had shrubs that would look good in the winter, but they desperately needed some ground cover plants to suppress weeds and keep the maintenance down.</p>

<p>This is an example of how not to do low maintenance.</p>

<p>When the garden had been redesigned for winter interest the planting chosen should have considered all seasons and the upkeep of the garden.</p>

<h3 id="choose-plants-that-are-easy-to-care-for">Choose plants that are easy to care for</h3>

<p>Plants have different needs some are higher maintenance than others.</p>

<p>For example, roses are beautiful, long flowering and often fragrant, but can be needy.</p>

<p>Our damp climate means they can be prone to black spot (a fungal disease) as well as other diseases, they are greedy plants and often need to be fed. If it’s a plant you love, then it’s worth it, but if you are looking for low maintenance, then it is best to choose plants which are easy to look after with a long flowering season or multiple points of interest.</p>

<p>Flowering shrubs which are easy to maintain are a good choice for low-maintenance gardens such as <em>Weigela florida</em> or <em>Hydrangea macrophylla.</em></p>

<p>You could also choose herbaceous perennials with a long flowering season <em>Geranium’Rozeanne’ salvia nachtvlinder</em> are some good examples.
<img src="/assets/img/blog1_image2_geranium_rozeanne.jpg" alt="" />
<em>Geranium ‘Rozeanne’</em></p>

<h3 id="hard-working-plants">Hard working plants</h3>

<p>As well as picking plants that are easy to look after I like plants that offer multiple seasons of interest in the garden and do more than one thing.</p>

<p>An example from my garden is in my mixed hedge.</p>

<p>I chose a deciduous hedging material that is native, good for wildlife and is thorny, so a deterrent to intruders, it has very early white blossom in late winter/ early spring, and has fruits and autumn colour.</p>

<p>It is called Prunus spinosa – commonly known as blackthorn.</p>

<p>I can also use the fruit to make sloe gin – bonus. This is not a choice for everyone as it doesn’t make a neat hedge, but it works well in the white border at the back of my garden.</p>

<h3 id="low-maintenance-is-about-choosing-your-plants-carefully">Low maintenance is about choosing your plants carefully</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure your plants work hard and with a little help from you, they will keep your garden looking good all year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try not to be swayed by plants in full bloom at your local garden centre, think carefully about what you want from the plant, what conditions the 
plant likes to grow in and how easy it is to look after.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Careful plant selection will help make your garden easier to manage and look good.</p>
