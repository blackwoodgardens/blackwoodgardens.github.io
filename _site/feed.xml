<p>Sound purchase decisions are required to make sure your new house meets all your criteria.</p>

<p>Get that all right and it may still not be the right house for you, you need to fall in love with it.</p>

<p>Falling in love with your future home starts before you even enter the house and the garden is a big part of that all-important first impression.</p>

<p>Here are some tips and advice to make the best use of your garden when selling your home.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-see-when-you-look-out-of-the-window">What do you see when you look out of the window?</h2>

<p>Stand back and look out the window- what do you see?</p>

<p>Have you created an attractive view from your window or are you looking at garden clutter?</p>

<p>Do you see wheelie bins, plastic toys or the back of a shed ?</p>

<p>Tidy up, put bins in a discreet place or screen it with a trellis and evergreen climber.</p>

<p>A well-appointed shrub, sculpture or water feature can provide added interest, acting as a focal point to direct your eye and enhance the view from the window.</p>

<h3 id="dont-reveal-everything-at-once">Don’t reveal everything at once</h3>
<p>Secret spaces in gardens are great. They can be playful and can reveal themselves gradually.</p>

<p>A potential buyer wandering around your garden would be delighted to discover a garden room, a hidden vegetable plot or a secluded seat.</p>

<h3 id="work-your-boundaries">Work your boundaries</h3>

<p>Garden boundaries are a key part of the garden.</p>

<p>Try softening hard landscaping such as walls and fences with climbers which can help blend it in with the surrounding landscape rather than creating a hard edge which can feel like an abrupt finish to the space.</p>

<p>If you have hedges make sure they are neatly trimmed.</p>

<p>Overgrown shrubs and hedges can take up a lot of space and make your garden feel smaller, so give them a good cut back and show the garden is loved.</p>

<h3 id="tidy-up">Tidy up</h3>

<p>The same goes for the garden as the house, cut your grass (unless it is an intentional meadow), edge your borders - it makes a big difference.</p>

<p>Weed your plant borders and if you have any gaps you can always fill them with some extra plants (summer annuals are a great way to do this quickly and cheaply), you don’t want to be able to see the soil.</p>

<p>Weed gravel areas, sweep paths, lift leaves from paths and lawns, and remove moss and algae from paths patios and decks so they are not slippery.</p>

<p>Cut hedges, and prune shrubs – especially evergreen structural shrubs as these are the backbone to other planting schemes.
<img src="/assets/img/Blog%203,%20image%202,%20Garden%20focal%20point.jpg" alt="Focal Point" /></p>

<h3 id="think-about-colour-and-scent">Think about colour and scent</h3>

<p>The type and style of garden you have will depend on the type of planting you have selected. For example, a bright colourful garden is welcoming, whereas an evergreen garden is calming, try to stick to one style of planting and think about the impression you want to give.</p>

<p>Scent evokes memories – so choose plants that provide pleasant smells to keep your garden front of mind. Lavender, nepetia or salvia are all good at path edges as they release the scent as you brush past.</p>

<p>Jasmine, honeysuckle or a climbing rose is good on a trellis which can be enjoyed without having to bend down.</p>

<h3 id="pots--less-is-more">Pots – less is more</h3>

<p>My golden rule with pots is less is more, go big and keep to a limited style and colour.</p>

<p>Lots of little pots of all different styles look cluttered.</p>

<p>Pots on either side of a path is a formal look which can lead you in that direction, it often works well at the top of steps.</p>

<p>One single pot at the end of the path acts as a focal point and a group of three pots works well as a collection in an area of hard landscaping.</p>

<p>If you need to buy new pots remember you can take always take them with you to your new house.

<h4 id="last-thing">Last thing</h4>

<p>If you aren’t a gardener and your garden is a blank canvas – then keep it that way, keep it clean and tidy and if the potential new buyer is a gardener they will see the potential of all that lovely space!</p>

<p><em>I could have saved myself a lot of time, money and energy</em></p>

<p>We can apply this scenario to lots of our life experiences.</p>

<p>This time I am talking about your garden and turning it into your dream garden.</p>

<p>How do we avoid some of those mistakes?</p>

<p>Well here are some tips for you…</p>

<h2 id="ground-prep-is-key">Ground prep is key</h2>
<p>Don’t take shortcuts.</p>

<p>More work now means less later.</p>

<p>Whether you are rejuvenating an old border or creating a new border, preparing the ground for planting is key.</p>

<p>This includes removing any perennial weeds, digging out old roots (cutting back will often see them come back bigger), getting rid of compaction, removing large 
stones, and, if needed, improving the fertility of the soil.</p>

<h2 id="know-your-soil-and-work-with-the-conditions">Know your soil and work with the conditions.</h2>
<p>The old saying ‘right plant in the right place’ is the right saying!</p>

<p>I meet people all the time who try and grow plants they like in the wrong conditions and it just results in sad straggly plants or dead experiments, poor owners and a garden dream that isn’t realised.</p>

<p>If you have heavy clay soil that stays cold and wet in the winter and compacted in the summer you should choose plants that can cope with those conditions.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-the-sun">Where is the sun?</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img/blog%204,%20image%201%20compass.jpg" alt="Compass" /></p>

<p>Which way does your garden face?</p>

<p>How much sun does the garden get a day?</p>

<p>Is your garden getting full sun; over 6 hours a day, or is it in partial shade or even full shade?</p>

<p>How windy is it?</p>

<p>Observing your garden conditions is important to choosing the plants that like the conditions you have.</p>

<p>You may get away with a shady plant in a sunny position, but not the other way around.</p>

<h2 id="less-is-more">Less is more</h2>
<p>Don’t cram the plants in.</p>

<p>They need space to grow.</p>

<p>You will be surprised how bare a newly planted border looks, but believe me those gaps will soon disappear, so don’t feel tempted to ignore the plant label and squeeze in an extra plant.</p>

<p>If your border is overplanted it could impact the plants’ health with reduced vigour of the plants.</p>

<p>You will also have spent too much money on plants and it won’t be long before you will need to remove extra plants, or split and divide existing plants to keep 
them in check, which is all extra money and effort.</p>

<p>If you don’t like seeing a few bare patches as the planting develops, then pop in some annuals for instant colour, they won’t last the winter and will fill up the gaps in the short term.
<img src="/assets/img/blog%204,%20image%202,%20new%20border%20planting.jpg" alt="New planting spaced evenly" /></p>

<h2 id="your-plant-label-is-your-friend">Your plant label is your friend</h2>
<p>If you are buying plants from a reputable garden centre or plant nursery your plants will be clearly labelled with the full plant name.</p>

<p>It will tell you the conditions the plant likes to grow in and it will tell you the ultimate height and spread of the plant.</p>

<p>So if the label says 200cm – it will grow 2 meters high!</p>

<p>If the spread says 600cm, then that is how far apart you need to have the plant from its neighbour.</p>

<p>This might all sound like a lot of work and effort and you may not want to spend time on the “trial and error” approach. Maybe you would prefer to have an expert help you plan your garden and avoid some mistakes…</p>]]></content><author><name>Anna</name></author><category term="chat" /><category term="chat" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If only I had known… I could have saved myself a lot of time, money and energy]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/blog%204,%20image%203%20plant%20label.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/blog%204,%20image%203%20plant%20label.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Front and Back Garden Dunfermline</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Dunfermline" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Front and Back Garden Dunfermline" /><published>2023-04-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-04-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Dunfermline</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Dunfermline"><![CDATA[<h2 id="back-garden">Back garden</h2>
<p>The brief was to improve access around the garden as it had awkward steps, a steep planting bank, slippery deck and rough gravel paths. The owner is a keen gardener and wanted lots of space for planting, a wildlife pond and space to grow vegetables. They also wanted a new seating area with a combined shed/greenhouse building and summerhouse.</p>

<p>The design uses lots of organic shapes and curves, featuring a smooth resin bound path which provides easy access around the garden.  A beautiful curved paddlestone wall separates upper and lower planting terraces. The central pond can be viewed from the house as well as from the summerhouse. The design includes a new porcelain patio and raised beds for growing veg. All the utilities are screened in the side passage.

<p>This project was about the rejuvination of a front garden in the conservation area of Portobello.

<p>The concrete path was changed to riven sandstone and edged with cropped setts. The bins were relocated into a new bin store away from the front of the house and a purpose made bench was added at the front door.</p>

<p>Many of the shrubs were retained and relocated during the build. The muddy lawns were replaced with gravel planting, giving the garden more colour, texture and biodiversity.</p>

<p>The materials were selected to compliment the house and area with  planting selected for its coastal location.</p>

She worked very collaboratively and creatively on the designs, taking the time to really understand our requirements before overseeing the landscapers and ensuring they delivered the work to a really high standard. Her choice of plants went way beyond anything we’d have done ourselves and look fantastic. Highest recommendation!”</p>

<p>This large modern garden was newly designed and landscaped when Blackwood Gardens  was brought in to do the planting design. The owners wanted low maintenance planting with texture and topiary to compliment and soften the hard landscaping materials.</p>

<p>The planting was designed with structural hornbeam pillars,  topiary evergreen shrubs and  specimen trees underplanted with textural grasses. The back border consisted of only white flowers and a  limited warm colour palette was used in the rest of the garden. Key plants were repeated to give the garden rhythm and  unity.</p>

<p>The planting is still maturing and images shown are in their first year. Mature trees and shrubs were used to help establish the garden.</p>

<p>This sunny enclosed garden is located in a conservation area of a historic fishing village in East Lothian. The owner wanted to increase the size of the seating area, while keeping it in the same location. The challenge was the house was accessed by  doors on different levels.</p>

<p>The client also wanted to  increase their privacy as the garden was overlooked  from a neighbouring property.</p>

<p>Broken paving was to be replaced and the owner wanted lots of plants and loved colour.</p>

<p>Planning permission was secured prior to the build starting.</p>

<p>The solution to the seating area was a new millboard composite deck on one level making the seating area accessible from different doors of the house. A larch wall topper was added for extra privacy to the old garden walls.
